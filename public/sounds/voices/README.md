# Voice/Emote Sound Files

Place your pre-recorded voice/emote sound files in this directory.

## Required Files

- `nice.mp3` - Positive feedback ("Nice!", "Good job!", "Great!")
- `oops.mp3` - Mistake acknowledgment ("Oops!", "Sorry!", "My bad!")

## Recording Tips

1. **Keep it short**: 0.5-1.5 seconds per sound
2. **Clear audio**: Record in a quiet environment
3. **Consistent volume**: Normalize all sounds to similar levels
4. **Format**: MP3, 128kbps is fine
5. **Tone**: Friendly and upbeat for a cooking game!

## Voice Ideas

You can record yourself saying:

- **Hello**: "Hey there!", "Hello!", "Hi!"
- **Help**: "Help me!", "I need help!", "Emergency!"
- **Yes**: "Yes!", "Got it!", "Okay!"
- **No**: "No!", "Nope!", "I can't!"
- **Thanks**: "Thanks!", "Thank you!", "Appreciate it!"
- **Hurry**: "Hurry up!", "Quick!", "Faster!"
- **Nice**: "Nice work!", "Awesome!", "Great!"
- **Oops**: "Oops!", "Sorry!", "My mistake!"

## File Format

- **Supported**: MP3, M4A, OGG, WAV (all work!)
- **Recommended**: M4A or MP3 for best quality/size ratio
- **Size**: Keep files small (<50KB per sound)
- **Quality**: 128kbps is sufficient for game sound effects

The game will automatically try loading in this order: M4A → MP3 → OGG → WAV

## Alternative: Text-to-Speech

If you don't want to record yourself:

1. Use online TTS services (Google TTS, Amazon Polly, etc.)
2. Or use free tools like:
